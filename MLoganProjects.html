			<p>Projects and PBL (Project Based Learning) are both an important part of the Dayton Regional STEM School's culture. During projects, we bond with other students and grow in <a href="MLogan5Qualities.html">The 5 Qualities</a>. PBL is a teaching style where students learn while doing the project. This is instead of learning all of the content before and then completing an assignment. When PBL is used, students can gain a deeper understanding of the content and learn from their mistakes, helping them to grow.</p>

			<!--<div class="center"><h2>My Growth, this Year, in the Qualities</h2></div>
			
			<p>I think that I grew in inquiry the most this year because I learned how to ask the right questions to find the answers that I needed and I now understand many topics on a deeper level. There is evidence for this in the editing of my Portfolio this year. To be able to code and edit while not being taught how to do this, I had to look up instructions on the Internet. To find what I the information I needed, I had to look up very specific words or phrases. I have grown in knowing what words or phrases will get me the information I need. My growth in inquiry has been beneficial because I can research much quicker and having a deeper understanding of topics. Read on to find out what this quality and the rest of the qualities mean to me and why they are important.</p>

			<br/>
			
			<div class="center"><h2>The 5 Qualities</h2></div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<h3>Persistence</h3>
	
			<p>Persistence can be used to push past failure to still reach a goal. When the objective is met, you will receive the benefit of learning from your mistakes and be more experienced. I believe that persistence means continue to strive to meet a goal despite any challenges you may face. I persisted while coding my website in 8th grade. When coding the main parts of my website, I would often realize there was a mistake because the page or image would not function correctly. When I noticed this, I would have to go back and scan through my code to try to find the problem. This was a common occurrence, but I still kept working to improve my website. Because I was persistent, I feel more confident in my ability to code, my web site was able to be finished, and I have learned to make less mistakes while coding.</p>

			</br>
			
			<h3>Communication</h3>
			
			<p>Being proficient in communication is crucial because we verbally and nonverbally communicate numerous times a day. Communicating successfully helps others to understand your stance on a subject without misunderstandings. Since the beginning of civilization, humans have communicated with each other and communication is a large aspect of our everyday lives, especially with the rise of social media. I believe that communication means to effectively get your point across so that the intended audience understands it. In school, communicating well can lead to group work being less stressful and no confusion within the group members. I grew in communication during the 7th grade Storybook project, where we used communication to critique other group’s Storybooks. I needed to explain to other groups how to improve their project using Green Hat, Black Hat, or Yellow Hat. To help me communicate my critique to the other group I had to use one of the assigned prompts (for example, “Have you thought about…”). Without this prompt they would have a much harder time understanding my commentary and the purpose of my suggestions.</p>

			</br>
			</br>
			
			<h3>Collaboration</h3>
			
			<p>Collaboration is a critical attribute because you can bring more ideas and perspectives to the project through collaborating. You can also receive differing opinions and critique on how the project is progressing. Getting other points of view will make the project more successful. I believe collaboration is working with others in a way that helps to meet the end goal or improve a product. I was able to use this during the Communicable Diseases Bulletin Board project (8th grade). My partner and I received critique that would help make our project better and worked with each other productively to make our Bulletin Board. My partner brought ideas to the project that I did not think of, elevating the result. Had our class not used collaboration between partners and through critique, then the outcome would have looked less pleasing, been less organized, and might even not have had accurate information.</p>

			</br>
			</br>
			
			<h3>Inquiry</h3>
			
			<p>Inquiry is an essential quality because it requires you to push past just memorizing facts and to connect with the information you learn. I believe inquiry means to seek information or knowledge to gain a deeper understanding on a topic. To be a true inquirer you must seek for more than the minimum resolution to questions and issues. I used this quality during the Lab Safety Poster project (8th grade), where we were given a sheet of paper with a lab safety rule. We then were required to create a mural that the viewer could look at and understand what not to do in a lab. Because we were not allowed to use words, I had obtain a deeper understanding of the lab safety rule so I could express it with only pictures.</p>

			</div>	
			
			</br>
			</br>
				
			<h3>Creativity</h3>
			
			<p>Finally, creativity is also an important trait to improve in because it helps to embrace originality, results in a more interesting product, and helps obstacles be seen as opportunities. I believe that creativity means to introduce inventive ideas that are better than the traditional train of thought or find an unconventional solution to a problem. I grew in creativity when designing the images for the Storybook Project in 7th grade. We were limited to using only three colors in our illustrations but still had to make our characters (planets) look unique. This required divergent thinking. We had to utilize size, texture, stroke, and a multitude of tools. I looked at the challenge of using three colors and saw it as an opening to experiment with tools and hues.</p>
