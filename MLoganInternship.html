			<p>The purpose of this career exploration report was to identify two possible futures careers, research them, and find four feasible internships in the area. The careers chosen to investigate and find internships for were an intelligence analyst and neurologist. To learn more about each occupation, essential questions were written; these questions helped to guide the research and ensure that the report included all the relevant and important information. Then, the critical subjects of salary, daily responsibilities, necessary qualities, work environment, education, and possible college majors were explored for each profession. The most prevalently used websites were O*NET, Northeastern University, International Relations EDU, Highland Hospital, and Prospects. A combination of government, informational, and university sites were used. Finally, internships were investigated, focusing on the Dayton area and the sought-after work environment. The most promising internship is the Air Force Cognitive Neuroscience Research Lab because it combines research, developing medical interventions, and break-through neurology. Next steps include looking for colleges that are top in the relevant majors for the career and contacting the potential internships.</p>

		<h2>Internship Log</h2>
		
		<h3>Entry 1</h3>
			<p>Dates: 7/20/21-7/21/21<br/>
			Hours: 6 <br/>
			I met with my mentor to discuss what I would do during my internship and was introduced to Bayesian statistics and the Monty Hall problem. I researched the Monty Hall problem and started answering questions on the Bayes analysis worksheet my mentor sent me. I got stuck after Question 6 and decided to email my mentor the following morning to ask if I had gotten something wrong or was doing the problem incorrectly.</p>

		<h3>Entry 2</h3>
			<p>Date: 7/22/21<br/>
			Hours: 4<br/>
			I emailed my mentor in the morning about the confusion and then finished the problems based on my existing knowledge. While doing this, I realized I had assumed there were receipts with neither milk nor cookies and was having a hard time finding the intersection because of that. I then went back and completed the problems again, assuming that there were no situations where there was neither event. I emailed my mentor a second time and updated him with my new answers.</p>

		<h3>Entry 3</h3>
			<p>Date: 7/31/21<br/>
			Hours: 4<br/>
			My mentor emailed me back and confirmed that there was no situation where event A and B didn’t apply. He then emailed me additional questions about Bayes’ theorem, and after some additional research, I completed these.</p>

		<h3>Entry 4</h3>
			<p>Dates: 8/1/21-8/2/21<br/>
			Hours: 6<br/>
			I had an extremely long car ride on the way to college visits, and I took this as a chance to do more research into conditional probability and statistics on YouTube. I also researched Data Analytics careers and opportunities.</p>

		<h3>Entry 6</h3>
			<p>Dates: 8/7/21-8/8/21<br/>
			Hours: 6<br/>
			I generated the data in Excel for my simulation of Bayes’ Theorem. I also researched different functions in Excel that I needed to complete the assignment.</p>

		<br/>
		
		<h3>Entry 7</h3>
			<p>Date: 8/9/21<br/>
			Hours: 4<br/>
			I evaluated the data using these functions to explore how the number of times the Monty Hall problem was simulated affected the results. I then concluded how it supported Bayes’ Theorem through the probability of two different results.</p>

		<h3>Entry 8</h3>
			<p>Dates: 8/10/21-8/11/21<br/>
			Hours: 8<br/>
			I created a PowerPoint presentation that explained conditional probability, Bayes' Theorem, the Monty Hall problem, the simulator and results, and my analysis. This was the product of all my research and learning about data analytics in this internship.</p>

		<h3>Entry 11</h3>
			<p>Dates: 8/21/21-8/22/21<br/>
			Hours: 4<br/>
			At this time, I realized that I had not completed enough hours through my internship and started looking for places where I could complete a small project to get the rest of my ours. I reached out to a family friend who gave me the contact information for someone at the Strategic Ohio Council for Higher Education. I emailed SOCHE to ask if they had an assignment that met the requirements mentioned above.</p>

		<h3>Entry 12</h3>
			<p>Dates: 8/24/21-8/25/21<br/>
			Hours: 6<br/>
			SOCHE gave me access to their website user data to evaluate their audience. I looked at this data and had to research the meaning of parts of it in order to understand what it represented. I selected what figures I deemed necessary and put them in an Excel document.</p>

		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		
		<p>During my internship, I was tasked with demonstrating how Bayes' Theorem could be applied to the Monty Hall Problem to understand data analytics better. Before learning about Bayes' Theorem, I first researched conditional probability. I found that conditional probability is the probability that an event will occur, given that another event has already transpired. For instance, to represent the probability of event A occurring given that event B has already happened, it would be written as P(A|B). This equation is articulated as "the probability of event A given event B." If solving for the probability of event B given that event A has occurred, it would be written as P(B|A). According to conditional probability, P(A|B) = P(A∩B)/P(B), meaning that the probability of event A given B is the probability of both event A and B happening divided by the probability of event B, and vice versa for P(B|A). When this equation is rearranged, it can also be defined as P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A))/P(B), also known as Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem can be more helpful than the conditional probability to find the likelihood of a first event, given that the second has already occurred.<br/>
In the Monty Hall Game Show, a contestant is presented with three doors. Behind one door, there is nothing, behind another is a goat, and behind the final door is the prize. The contestant chooses between Door #1, #2, or #3. The contestant is then shown the contents behind a door they did not select, one that does not contain the prize. I created an Excel simulator with the goal of finding a pattern that could increase the chance of a contestant winning the prize by selecting the correct door. In my simulator, I randomly generated the door number that the contestant selects and the door number that the prize is behind. If the door that the contestant chooses and the door that the prize is behind are the same numbers, then the contestant will win without changing the door. If this does not happen, Monty Hall opens the door for the contestant that does not contain the prize. I counted the number of times that the door was changed, and the contestant won and solved for the probability of this happening. I did the same for the chance of the contestant not changing the door and winning.<br/>
When the contestant is introduced to the three doors, there is a 1/3 chance that the prize is behind any of the doors. The contestant then selects a door with this 1/3 probability of the prize being behind it, and Monty Hall opens one of the other doors. The door does not contain the prize, meaning there is now a 2/3 chance that the prize is behind the final door. I can conclude from this that ideally 1/3 of the time, the prize will be behind the door if the contestant does not change, and 2/3 of the time, the prize will be behind the final door, meaning that the contestant must change. As the sample size increased in my Excel simulator, the probability more accurately represented 1/3 for keeping the door and 2/3 for changing the door.<br/>
One of the most challenging parts of this internship was completing it remotely. I often had questions or didn't understand a problem and did not have someone I could ask right away. For instance, in Entry 1, I was trying to answer "How many receipts showed a purchase of both cookies and milk (event B and A)?". I had assumed that there were receipts with neither milk nor cookies for these problems. This meant that I had a variable in every answer and ended with an expression rather than a percentage. Unbeknownst to me, this particular question was unsolvable if neither was an option. After spending a long time considering how to simplify the equation into an expression without enough information, I finally emailed my mentor, asking for some clarification. The following morning, I decided to do some research and noticed that none of the examples of conditional probability I looked at considered a situation where neither event happened. I went back to the questions and tried again, finally finding numbers that made sense. My mentor emailed me later on, confirming my conclusion. Despite struggling with not having answers instantly, I learned patience and how to research and discover things for myself, helping me to fully comprehend concepts on my own.<br/>
This internship introduced me to statistics and data analytics. I have found that I enjoy the math behind data analytics and how it can be used to draw conclusions from large amounts of data. I plan to take data science courses in college to learn more about collecting and applying information and explore how this applies to computer science.</p>
