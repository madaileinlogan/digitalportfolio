			<h3>Coding Progression in 7th Grade...</h3>
			
			<ul id="list">
				<li>I have learned that the &lt;html&gt; element holds the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; elements. </li>

				<li>I have learned that the &lt;em&gt; element and &lt;i&gt; element both italicize text and are inline elements, but when using a screen reader the text inside the &lt;em&gt; element is spoken in a different voice while the text inside the &lt;i&gt; element is spoken in the same voice as the rest of the text on the web page.</li>
				
				<li>I have learned that the &lt;strong&gt; element and the &lt;b&gt; both bold text and are inline elements, but when using a screen reader the text inside the &lt;strong&gt; element is emphasized when spoken much more than the text inside the &lt;b&gt; element.</li>

				<li>I have learned that the &lt;p&gt; element is a block element and tells the browser to separate your content in to paragraphs.</li>
				
				<li>I have learned that attributes are extra pieces of information attached to elements and goes inside the opening tag before the end bracket.</li>
				
				<li>I have learned that whitespace are characters like spaces, tabs, carriage returns (enter), and that the web browser will ignore any whitespace you enter and make its own decision on how to format the text.</li>
				
				<li>I have learned that the &lt;blockquote&gt; element is used when quoting from another person or source.</li>
				
				<li>I have learned that the &lt;cite&gt; element is used to identify the author or speaker of the a quote and is placed around the author or speakers name.</li>
				
				<li>I have learned that the &lt;head&gt; element contains all the information that will not be shown on the web page and also includes all the information about the page and instructions for the browser.</li>

				<li>I have learned that the &lt;ol&gt; element creates an ordered list where the order of the items is important, each entry will automatically get a number or letter in front of each list item.</li>
				
				<li>I have learned that the &lt;li&gt; is placed a the beginning and end of each list item  in an ordered list and unordered list so the browser knows where each entry begins and ends and will place a letter, number, dash, or bullet point there.</li>
				
				<li>I have learned that the &lt;ul&gt; element contains points that are made in no particular order and will place a dash or bullet point before each list entry.</li>
				
				<li>I have learned how to create a CSS file that you can save all your styles in so it does not clutter your code.</li>

				<li>I have learned that the &lt;hr&gt; element is used to create a line on your web page and can section off text or divide the web page in to sections (similar to a &lt;div&gt; tag) and can be styled by adjusting the background color, width, or thickness through external CSS.</li>

			<h3>Summary of Coding Growth:</h3>
			
			<p>I believe that I have gained a basic understanding of CSS and HTML. But, more important than what I learned, I found out how much I don't know. Because I have taught myself how to code since eighth grade, I do not follow many formatting rules and use code in unconventional ways. This year, I have finally started to fix some of this. I have learned that line breaks should not be used as a formatting tool, percentages are not supposed to be used in some CSS formatting, and I have been using &lt;div&gt; in the wrong situations. Finding out what I do not know will only help me make my website more professional and easy to use.</p>
