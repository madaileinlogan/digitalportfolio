			<h2>Greatest Growth Statement</h2>
			
			<p>My greatest growth while at DRSS was becoming more courageous and gaining self-confidence. This growth has led me to new experiences and to find new passions. Being more extroverted and willing to go outside of my comfort zone will allow me to succeed in college and have better job opportunities. In college, everything and everyone is new, and not letting this overwhelm me will help me enjoy it more, meet more people, and join more extracurriculars. At college, you must advocate for yourself, and at DRSS, I have learned and practiced how to push myself to talk to teachers and be honest with them. In the job interviewing process, most companies look for team players with communication skills. Extroversion offers an edge as these things will seem more natural.</p>

			<p>The most significant leap I have taken at DRSS is most likely the courage it took to attend in 6th grade. I had just finished at a middle school where I was bullied for a few years, and after my parents discovered the type of education offered at my district high school, they decided to start researching other options. We applied to DRSS and received my acceptance letter later in the summer. I was able to do a tour where new students follow around a student in the grade above you for a day. This allowed me to see that this school was an excellent fit for me, but that did not stop the anxiety from attending a school where I knew no one. I was one of the only students to come from north of I-75, increasing my worries. My parents assured me that I had no other option, so I reluctantly went on the first day. Despite my initial shyness, I was able to make friends, which is what helped me come back every day after.</p>

			<p>CISV (Children's International Summer Village) is an international youth peace-focused organization made up of chapters worldwide. It is run and maintained mainly by the youth in the chapters and the non-profit host's camps for specific ages. Delegations of four or more children come from up to 12 countries. The program can be anywhere from 2 weeks to a month. At 11, I experienced my first traveling experience with CISV. The program was called "Village," and I traveled with one other girl, two boys, and an adult from the US to Finland. There I spent a month with forty-eight 11-year-olds from twelve different countries and did educational activities, learned about other cultures, and made friends with people from around the world. Before leaving my parents, home, and country for a month, I had a few panic attacks, overwhelmed by the idea of a setting so unfamiliar. But, I overcame this and had one of the most impactful experiences of my life. I then went on to do other camps at ages 12, 13, and 15. Each time I would get anxious before leaving but would be able to overlook this, knowing that I had already mastered my feelings once and picturing how much fun I would have.</p>

			<div class="center">
				<img src="Images/Pictures/12thGradePage/MLogan_ScienceFairArtifact.jpg" alt="Picture Depicting Science Fair" width="40%">
			</div>  <!-- End of Center -->
			
			<p>In sophomore year, I designed a Science Fair project with my partner Aruna. We were halfway done with our project when she unexpectedly transferred to a school in Arizona. This made me extremely nervous when Science Fair presentations came around, and I had to present everything by myself. But, I studied the material, read up on other related topics that the evaluators could ask me questions about, and ended up receiving a multitude of awards that year.</p>

			<h3>Artifact 4</h3>
			
			<div class="center">
				<img src="Images/Pictures/12thGradePage/MLogan_HockeyArtifact.jpg" alt="Picture Depicting Hockey" width="60%">
			</div>  <!-- End of Center -->
			
			<p>At the end of my sophomore year, I decided to try hockey and join my high school team. When I first decided to do this, I had no idea how hard it would be. First, I had to make the transition from figure skating to hockey. I came to open skates and practiced my shooting and stick handling, preparing for Troy High School Hockey’s Summer Camp. But when the camp came around, I was ill-prepared, not having played a contact sport before, barely able to stickhandle, scarcely an idea how to play hockey, and having to learn all of this in front of twenty teenage boys. It was probably my worst nightmare. It didn’t get any easier, and I was constantly embarrassed and uncomfortable. But I showed up to every practice at 5:30 am, I worked on my shooting, I observed when plays were explained, and I ended the season with the best plus/minus on the team (amount of goals scored by your team minus the number of goals scored against you while you are on the ice). I discovered a new passion because of overcoming my preconceived limitations.</p>

			</div>  <!-- End of Center -->
			
			<p>At the beginning of my senior year, I wanted to explore my interests to choose a college major with more knowledge. I decided that the best way to do this was through an elective named CAMP Dosser. This class gave me experiential learning in additive manufacturing, something I had no previous experience in. I figured that many other inexperienced people would be applying to join the class due to the work experience offered. I was extremely surprised when I came to training, and there were only four other students, all of whom owned a 3D printer or had extensive additive manufacturing knowledge. Despite this, I stuck with CAMP Dosser and have learned so much about using different manufacturing techniques because of it.</p>
